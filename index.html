  <p class="amazing">An amazing animal that is the cutest dog ever seen in the history of mankind.</p>
  <p>My pet dog Rex.Always at my beck and call, always there whenever I need him for company,
    play and strolls.</p>
  <p>His heavy bark that comes from deep within the chest of the huge creature threatens away the thought of stealing from people's minds, let alone the thugs.</p>
  <p class="amazing">I simply love my dog for one reason; he gives you every reason to love him.</p>
  <p>Here is a variety of things my dog likes:<span class="main">Chewing</span> <span class="activity">boots</span>, <span class="main">Chasing</span> its own <span class="activity">tail</span>,<span class="main">Running</span> in the <span class="activity">park</span></p>
