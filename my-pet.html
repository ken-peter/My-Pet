  <p>An amazing animal that is the cutest dog ever seen in the history of mankind.</p>
  <p>My pet dog Rex.Always at my beck and call, always there whenever I need him for company,
    play and strolls.</p>
  <p>His heavy bark that comes from deep within the chest of the huge creature threatens away the thought of stealing from people's minds, let alone the thugs.</p>
  <p>I simply love my dog for one reason; he gives you every reason to love him.</p>
